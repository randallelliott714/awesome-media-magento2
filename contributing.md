## General Quality Standard

To get on the list, PR's should follow some quality standards. They should:

* Generally useful to the community.
* Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise).
* Stable.
* Documented.

### Extension Quality Standard

To add an awesome Magento related extension, there are some additional Quality Gates to pass:

* Make sure your Code follows the [Magento Code Style](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/coding-standards/bk-coding-standards.html) 
* Make sure your Extension's README explains the following parts:
 * General Purpose of the Extension.
 * How to Install.
 * Supported Magento Versions.
 * Requirements (e.g. PHP Version).
* At least one stable release.
* Make sure, the Extension is maintained by someone from time to time.
* Make sure, your Code is tested.

For Magento 1 Extensions, there is no need to pass every quality gate. I know it is quite a pain to write Tests or find the official Coding Standard. Think of the awesome Magento Extensions like: 

> These Extensions are battleproofed by a huge community of experts, they are supported and I will get an answer if I'll stuck.

If you need help to pass the quality gates, add your questions to the PR too. 

## Blog Quality Standard

Make sure you pass the following Quality Gates:

* The Blog itself should contain posts from at least 3 Months ago.
* The Blog should be focused on Magento.
* There should be at least one article a month.


Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you!
